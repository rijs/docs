# Ripple

Ripple is a modular fullstack framework. In the diverse and fast-moving world of JavaScript, this makes it easy to opt-out of an experimental module, swap a module in a particular use case for a more performant one, or simply bolt-on a new module, without having to migrate to a whole new framework.
