# Tests

```
npm run test
```

This will run [popper](https://github.com/pemrouz/popper), which will run tests across browsers and node, reporting results, performance and coverage - all refreshed on file change. Open the test page (:1945) to run the tests. Open the dashboard to see the results (:1945/dashboard). A page where you can view the results for the latest commit will be available on the website soon. For some server-side only modules (e.g. mysql), the tests will just be run on the server.
